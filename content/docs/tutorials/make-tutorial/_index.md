# Tutorial: Pipeline building and automation

## Learning goals

* Learn how to organize your project with a coherent directory structure
* Conceive your project as a pipeline
* Separate your code into smaller chunks (each one with inputs, transformations and outputs)
* Automate workflows and make them reproducible using `make`
<!--* Documenting Source Code and Pipeline workflows
* Describe raw data using a template
-->

## Planning

- Please plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting started

1. In-class tutorial ([view slides](tutorial.html))
2. After-class exercises ([View](make-tutorial.html), [Download; right click - download file as](make-tutorial.Rmd))


<!--
In the live session of this week, we'll see how we can quickly make changes to the workflow (e.g., swapping around files and directories) without breaking the pipeline.
- It's important you've covered the learn & practice part yourself, before attending the live stream.
-->
<!--Make sure to fully understand the details of the practise [workflow](https://tsh-website.netlify.app/tutorials/more-tutorials/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow-overview/), to get most out of this session!
